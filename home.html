									<p>Tax Administration
										Prior to the year 2008, there were virtually no automated systems in all ANSG MDAs, including AIRS. This situation bred corruption, slow workflow and poor record-keeping in the businesses of Government and governance. At AiRS, e-tax administration is in effect in the areas of Assessment and Collection of taxes assessed, performance reporting, audit trails and inter-staff/ departmental internal mail communications. AiRS has advanced plans to enable and encourage individuals and companies to do self-assessments 
										using our electronic Tax Management System. The various avenues of e-governance at AiRS include;.</p>

									<p >Electronic payment solution owned by Interswitch – the paydirect platform: This became imperative as it was realised that the funds in government coffers varied at a great length with total amounts receipted at the end of reporting periods. Therefore, to narrow/ close-up the gap, Pay Direct e-slip, a real-time credit system was to be the major 
										supporting/ evidential document for the issuance of government revenue receipts.</p>

									<p>Kano State Motor Vehicle Administration System (KMVAS): This started as AutoReg, for Vehicle Registration and was initially totally contracted to a consultant, OlisWarren Associates. Vehicle information were captured on a database which serves as a point of reference for future fees and change of Vehicle information. This replaced the Manual vehicle licensing operations and insurance. The activity of Autoreg were domiciled within the Vehicle licensing offices of the AIRS for control. In 2014, there became a need to further strengthen the controls on Autoreg by introducing the AMVAS to domicile all 
										vehicle licensing payments with the State government and make the consultant – AutoReg subject to a fee.</p>

									<p >KIRS Tax Management System (TMS): This solution was mooted in mid-2015 by the incumbent leadership of the AIRS and was bought by the State government as part of the moves to prevent leakages of government revenue at the tax assessment stage of the AIRS Operations loop. The solution is to assign Tax IDs to taxpayers, and assessment IDs to each assessment, to ensure that the exact amount assessed gets paid and to maintain a database of taxpayers and tax-remitting organisations and generate reports on all assessments made, period and revenue-wise. It is being executed by a consultant and is expected to kick-start before the end of the 3rd quarter of 2016.
										 The proposition is that the TMS will be integrated to the existing Paydirect.</p>
